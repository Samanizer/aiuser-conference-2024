The poem could delve into the struggles faced by these employees, drawing parallels to Dante's depiction of tormented souls in Hell. Additionally, the premise of \"The temptation of the golden arches\" could be woven into this poem, highlighting how the allure and addictive nature of McDonald's food can further intensify the infernal experience for both customers and employees.
